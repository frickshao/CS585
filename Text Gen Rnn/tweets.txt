@heyjoshhaines that’s right, everything right of center is “racist” and “homophobic” to lefties. too bad, because no one’s buying your bullshit propaganda anymore. also, if this is a “white supremacist” group than it’s the most diverse one anyone’s ever seen. idiot. https://t.co/rlkgndyxth

@jayhawklas i’m probably too down to earth sometimes....lol. ;)

we said that because obama really was a divisive and weak president. nevertheless, conservatives aren’t saying that this guy isn’t responsible for the fake bombs....we’re saying you better look for who helped him and why, cause he didn’t do it alone and it reeks of conspiracy. https://t.co/gf6tawhdye

@trumpwatching1 @bobbyaxxelrod typical selfish urban leftie....guns are bad because he doesn’t personally need one so f_____ everyone else that does.

yea, new york post.....he’s clearly a raging racist, or whatever false narrative you’re trying to push. patriotism does not equal “hate group” no matter how much you commies try.... @nypost https://t.co/uguskdgfsz

seattle passed a law that gun owners must keep their guns locked up....cause that’s so handy when you need it in the middle of the night. and of course the liberal judge wouldn’t even look at the appeal...

hey lefties, screaming at people that they need to believe ford’s crappy testimony “just because she’s a woman” is going to work out for you about as well as it did when you used it for hillary’s campaign....

the venn diagram of people that believe ford’s flimsy testimony, and those that thought mike pence was a stuffy christian for refusing to have dinner with women without his wife present....is a circle. ??

it’s bad enough the left is using contrived and malicious lies to ruin the life of a good man....but they’re doing it solely because they’re worried they might lose the right to kill unborn babies on demand. this is their ultimate priority, this is the evil what we’re up against.

the same women that believe kavanaugh’s accuser despite her flimsy testimony and heavy ulterior motive, are the same broads that complained pence was an uppity christian for refusing to have dinner with anyone but his wife. turns out pence has it right all along....

@me3episodes waiting 35 years until someone was famous is what hurt ford’s credibility. that, and there are bigger holes in her story than in stormy daniels.

the only way it’s “his fault” is that the left’s rabid hatred for anything trump leaked over and landed wrongfully onto kavanaugh in the worst way. because despite being two years in already, they still can’t handle the fact they didn’t get their stupid way. https://t.co/om3o89sv8u

ford is the symbolic equivalent of waiting 35 years to sue someone and only after you saw that they won the lottery in the newspaper. i don’t just “believe her” because she’s female. i have a right to discern what i believe to be true based on the actual facts and motive on hand.

it’s been interesting watching lefties lose their mind at green party voters all day. calling them traitors, russian bots, and “worse than trump supporters.” not realizing they just reminded #walkaway democrats that there’s another place for them to go.

how self centered and delusional do you think one needs to be, to assume everyone that voted for the green party would have voted blue....if russia hadn’t made them do it? huh? https://t.co/egm30ocum0

@dwayne4561 i’m an american, other americans do come first to me into this world. it’s why our military risk their lives defending it. individual &gt; family &gt; community &gt; state &gt; country &gt; then everyone else in the world

@mgileot1 our country is not broken. there are powers that be that want it to seem that way because emotionally distraught people are easy to control.

but according to leftists this never happens. next you’re going to try to tell me socialism doesn’t work.... https://t.co/uh801qmzgg

this officer was shot because lefties would rather complain, protest, and hinder enforcing immigration than keep our country safe. sorry, but the lives of american citizens are more important than whatever  irrational “woke” trend your trump hating friends pulled out their ass. https://t.co/ll9ikh9wor

i did my college thesis on king phillip’s war. the colonists couldn’t defeat the natives they were fighting, so they employed the native’s rival tribes to fight for them. you should always have the foresight to know who you’re helping and why...and also that you might be next.

supporting law enforcement is “weak minded?” we’re all supposed to just trust everyone to police themselves while living in lawless anarchy, or something?

@prisonplanet i’ve compiled a list of pages i’ve reported that facebook hasn’t removed for “hate speech.” notice any difference..... https://t.co/zlnxgxczso

facebook has permanently removed infowars over what it deems as “hate speech.” what i find interesting, is that they have not removed any of the pages below that i‘ve previously reported. they’re not even trying to hide their agenda anymore.... https://t.co/xgqg4ofrtm

@mgileot1 @officialspgb @davejon405 because it’s “not real socialism.” real socialism involves every human being magically working together, agreeably and equally, and giving up stuff to wait their turn for it in advance or else!!!! lol.

@officialspgb @davejon405 it’s not “freedom” if i’m being forced what to do by mob rule, is it? behind every socialist loving commie is someone hoping that they’ll be the ones in charge when the time comes. totalitarianism hidden inside the trojan horse of an unattainable false utopia...

@farsay3030 @officialspgb @cernovich as a working actor in hollywood that runs a very public conservative page, i can tell you....there are so many secret trump supporters that come up and thank me for what i do. the left just has bullied them into silence with the fear of blacklisting and by controlling the media.
